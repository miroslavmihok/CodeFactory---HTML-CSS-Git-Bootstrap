        <p>
            Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
            Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish, ya bish)
            Home invasion was persuasive (Was persuasive, was persuasive)
            From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
            Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
            Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)
            I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (Tell my bros, tell my bros)
            Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on, "Let Burn" came on)
            Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
            Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
            The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind, free our mind)
            Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs, see dollar signs)
            You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
            A silver spoon, I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
            And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew, we never knew)
            Go at a reverend for the revenue

        <p>
            Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (Like rappers do, like rappers do)
        Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school, way after school)
        You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)
        Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (Thinkin' rational, that's rational)
        Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
        Another casualty at war, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
        Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (My Tony head, my Tony head)
        He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
        That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same, won't be the same)
        A Louis belt that never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
        But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', that day is jerkin')
        Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin', Pirellis skirtin')
        Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
        Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
        They say your hood is a pot o' gold (A pot o' gold, a pot o' gold)
        And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

        [Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
        It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
        Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
        Everybody gon' respect the shooter
        But the one in front of the gun lives forever
        (The one in front of the gun, forever)
        And I been hustlin' all-day
        This-a-way, that-a-way
        Through canals and alleyways, just to say
        Money trees is the perfect place for shade
        And that's jus' how I feel

            Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
        Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way!
        Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
        Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
        Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
        Love one of you bucket headed hoes? No way!
        Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
        Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
        [Verse 3: Jay Rock]
        'Magine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
        Santa Claus don't miss them stockings; liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
        Bakin' soda YOLA whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
        My homeboy just dome'd a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
        Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
        What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
        Gotta provide for my daughter n'em—get the fuck up out my way, bish!
        Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bish!
        Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
        If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
        From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood
        Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
        Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
        Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
        In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
        Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree
        </p>

        <h3>[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]</h3>

            It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
        Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
        Everybody gon' respect the shooter
        But the one in front of the gun lives forever
        (The one in front of the gun, forever)
        And I been hustlin' all-day
        This-a-way, that-a-way
        Through canals and alleyways, just to say
